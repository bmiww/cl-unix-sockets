# UNIX socket support for Common Lisp

Most major Lisp implementations don't come with any in-built support
for UNIX sockets. This is a simple library that provides a reasonable
implementation using FFI.

At the moment I'm prioritizing stability over performance (so for
instance I don't have stream-read-sequence implemented). In the
future, we'll add those tweaks.
